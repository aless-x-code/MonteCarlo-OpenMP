# MonteCarlo-OpenMP

 <b> Approximate Pi (Monte Carlo Method) C++, OpenMP, Parallels Desktop, ChatGTP </b>	<br>
• A C++ program that applies the Monte Carlo simulation to approximate Pi <br>
• Program utilizes OpenMP for multi-threading running of the simulation. Run time(ms) vs threads: (107,772 - 2), (57,056 - 4), (45,865 - 8). <br>
• Program is executed on Windows 11 VM using Parallels Desktop application <br>
• Use of ChatGTP to improve random numbers generator, resulting in a run time cut of ~40,000ms
