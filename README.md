# MonteCarlo-OpenMP

**Approximate Pi (Monte Carlo Method) C++, OpenMP, Parallels Desktop, ChatGTP	<br>
A C++ program that applies the Monte Carlo simulation to approximate Pi
Program utilizes OpenMP for multi-threading running of the simulation. Run time(ms) vs threads: (107,772 - 2), (57,056 - 4), (45,865 - 8).
Program is executed on Windows 11 VM using Parallels Desktop application
Use of ChatGTP to improve random numbers generator, resulting in a run time cut of ~40,000ms
